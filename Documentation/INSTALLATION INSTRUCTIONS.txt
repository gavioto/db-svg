-------------------------------------------------------------------
Same as above.

This project is built with maven, so once you install maven you can easily tweak the setup and do a full build.
For example, if there are problems writing to the internal SQLite database, you can change
the path in the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/app-context.xml file and recompile the project with the command: "mvn clean install".

To start the application using an embedded jetty web server, simply use the command: "mvn jetty:run", then go to http://localhost:8080/DB-SVG
